[Golf] Also, the whole idea of this Starlight thing is not really clear for me 
because like it looks like it can be avoided.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.500
You just, it's not crucial to have it.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:22.310
The main reason to have it, to uh, to make your, uh, how it's called, like, not health but

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.700
the armor to increase your shield and armor.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.060
And that's pretty much it.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.010
[Foxtrot] Similar to what he was saying, so what would happen is you
would get into a firefight 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.300
and then like, whatever armor you went through, and the firefight,
you would kind of replenish that using the Starlight that you picked up 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.940
and then go on to your next fight. But like I found that it was
completely unnecessary unless you needed to replenish your armour.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.680
That was but the only time that I used it as well.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.220
So, I mean, it was one of those things where it was like you could go an entire 
round without ever once having to pick it up

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.740
and still win the round. And it wasn't crucial to that.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.890
So I feel like if it's gonna be the main experience of the game,
it needs to be something worth more crucial.
